## Description

- Details screen show the news in detail

## Hilt Dependency
Why i used Hilt over Dagger
-Hilt is extension to the dagger library
-This library removes lot of boilerplate code that we need to write
-No worries to declare Components.those who have worked on dagger would know how components creation is filthy.
-Hilt automatically generates Components for every module
